Dexter is a friendly Twitter bot that promotes sentiment expression by analyzing feelings from people he interacts with, building a response and sharing a song that might help them.

Once Dexter is tagged in a tweet, he analyzes the emotions that are present in the text using a Multichannel Convolutional Neural Network and then builds a response given a set of predefined answers and then answers back to the user.
