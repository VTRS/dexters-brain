## How to collaborate


### What do I need to know to collaborate?

Nothing really. You don't need to be an expert programmer, you just need to be interested in the project an willing to give the best of you. So, what can you do to improve Dexter? 	:arrow_down:

### 1. Collaborate in @dexterthebot's music database.

If you want to be part of the people that curates the playlists where Dexter gets the music he recommends, join the team by contacting the creator by [email](mailto:victor@dxtr.mx) with "Join music team" as subject.

### 2. Collaborate in @dexterthebot's response database.

Dexter has some predefined responses according to the emotion that is going to talk about. If you would like to collaborate in this matter you can either contact the creator by email with your responses or add them yourself to the answers.json file and do a pull request. This responses will be reviewed to be sure that they map the personality of the bot.

### 3. Improve twitter of spotify interaction.

If you have any idea on how to improve the interactions with spotify's or twitter's API feel free to join the git and work with us.

### 4. Improve the machine learning algorithm.
